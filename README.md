# Sniper Bot

## Purpose

This bot helps you to compete with other trading bots or traders when buying a cryptocurrency on the PancakeSwap DEX. The bot can be used for fairlaunch ( stealthlaunch ) projects or if you just want to buy as fast as possible on PancakeSwap trading pair creation. If a project is hype and the community which is willing to buy the particular token is quite big, then it is close to impossible to compete manually with bots or traders. PancakeSwap, PooCoin, etc are known to have slow UX which will only make your buying transaction slower and in the end you might buy at not desired price. For long time bots have been integral part of trading not only for the cryptocurrencies, but also for stocks, fiat currencies, etc.
